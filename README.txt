Project Brief: Create a chatbot in Python

We have created a simple text-based pokemon game where in a player enters what they would like to happen,
following which the message is interpreted by the chatbot which then executes appropriate functions.

In terms of divison of labour, Lewis mainly worked on the underlying game and all the respective mechanics, 
while Mohit worked on the Chatbot which sort of sits on top of the game as a seperate layer.
Both parts could work seperately from one another, but probably wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.
